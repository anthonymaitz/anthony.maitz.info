<p>I am a product manager with ten years of experience making consumer products, video games, and interactive experiences. I have built and lead teams as large as 100 people with budgets ranging from thousands to millions of dollars. Along the way, I have coached clients and colleagues in data-driven design, agile methodologies, and product management.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us">ThoughtWorks</a></h3>

<p>As a lead product strategist and member of the emerging technologies group, I have helped leaders of start-ups and fortune 500 companies around the world deliver products that matter to their users; and to occasionally do the impossible.
As the social and economic justice lead for San Francisco, I&#8217;ve organized office initiatives to help activists, non-profits, and a few radical librarians by developing tools and programs to increase their impact and protect vulnerable communities.</p>
