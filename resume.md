I am a product manager with ten years of experience making consumer products, video games, and interactive experiences. I have built and lead teams as large as 100 people with budgets ranging from thousands to millions of dollars. Along the way, I have coached clients and colleagues in data-driven design, agile methodologies, and product management.

### [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/about-us)
As a lead product strategist and member of the emerging technologies group, I have helped leaders of start-ups and fortune 500 companies around the world deliver products that matter to their users; and to occasionally do the impossible.
As the social and economic justice lead for San Francisco, I've organized office initiatives to help activists, non-profits, and a few radical librarians by developing tools and programs to increase their impact and protect vulnerable communities.
