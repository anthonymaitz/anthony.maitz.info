I am a product manager with more than ten years of experience making consumer products, video games, and interactive experiences. I have built and led teams as large as 100 people with budgets ranging from thousands to millions of dollars. Along the way, I have coached clients and colleagues in data-driven design, agile methodologies, and product management.

> Anthony is a key member to each product program I work in. He has the ability to fluidly move across an organization from executive advisement and organizational strategy all the way to interface design and user testing strategies. He consistently fills roles across our consulting portfolio as VP of Product. He manages technology programs and stays connected to teams throughout. He is a great example of someone who leads from the trenches. I would highly recommend Anthony for leadership positions across any technology program.

> Product is in Anthony's blood. He focuses on delighting the customer and passionately pursues the designs and features that will best drive the business forward. He is that rare product talent who also has a technical background that allows him to make his own MVPs.
> [Sean Atkins]

> Tony is a brilliant creative thinker and comes with loads of passionate and infectious energy. When Tony gets excited about something, it's nearly impossible to not get fired up yourself. He is a mix of right and left brain, being able to manage technical analysis and foresight, while charging forward with imaginative creative vision. Being now in a new environment and position, one of the first things I realized here was how much of a better designer and creative thinker I am for having worked under Tony's guidance and leadership.
