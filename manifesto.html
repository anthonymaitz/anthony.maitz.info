<pre><code>Let's build new things, useful things, make-our-world-better things.
Let's build new worlds.

Let's help each other to learn and grow and actualize.
Let's save each other.

Let's not use hate, or exclusion, or guilt.
Let's use our love.

In what we make.
In what we say.
In what we do.

And those who are touched by us;
build worlds, save lives, with love.
